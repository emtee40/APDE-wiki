APDE
====

A [Processing](https://processing.org/) IDE for creating and running sketches on an Android device. What follows is a description of APDE's concepts, features, and basic use.

You can download APDE from the [releases page](https://bit.ly/3wVXa6g).

Background
----------

The initialism APDE (for Android Processing Development Environment) may prove to be temporary. It is kept for lack of anything better.

APDE is based entirely on the Android mode for the PDE. Before you dive too far into coding, be sure to read through the [Android Processing wiki page](http://wiki.processing.org/w/Android)... except, skip the parts about installing the SDK. You should only look for the differences in the language between "normal" mode and Android mode because these carry over to APDE.

APDE runs on Android versions 2.3 Gingerbread to the latest version (currently 5.0 Lollipop). Theoretically, I could have supported earlier versions of Android, but Processing only supports 2.3+. In 2.3, the app will appear slightly different when compared with the "newer" versions (Android 3.0+, which introduced the Action Bar design pattern).

I have tested the editor on an Asus Nexus 7 running Android 5.0, a Samsung Galaxy S5, an HTC One M8, and a Samsung Galaxy S4, all running Android 4.4.4, as well as several emulators running earlier versions, including 4.2.2, 3.2, and 2.3.3.

The editor requires the following permissions:
 - *Modify and delete the contents of your USB storage* - needed to store sketches in the external storage. Note: If you don't have an external storage, you can use the internal storage instead (in Settings).
 - *Control vibration* - vibration is used for haptic feedback in rare instances within the app. If you wish to disable it, you can do so from the Settings menu (devices without a vibrator do not have to worry about this).
 - *Test access to protected storage* - this also has to do with writing to the external storage. This permission isn't actually necessary yet, but it will be needed in future versions of Android.

The editor is not necessarily designed to be used on a phone, although it is possible. If you plan to do so, do *not* plan on using landscape orientation (the editing area will become almost completely covered by the software keyboard). I recommend either getting a hardware/bluetooth keyboard or a more advanced software keyboard (like [Hacker's Keyboard](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.pocketworkstation.pckeyboard&hl=en), which is free). Some keyboard shortcuts are enabled. APDE includes a small special character tray above the software keyboard to make it easier to type coding symbols (like `{`, `;`, etc) if you really insist on using a phone. Tablets are obviously the device of choice.

I am aware of two existing Java IDEs capable of building Android applications on a device; they are [AIDE](http://www.android-ide.com/) and [Java-IDE-Droid](http://code.google.com/p/java-ide-droid/). Java-IDE-Droid is open source and relatively unmaintained... while AIDE can be seen as the present industry leader of mobile development platforms, comparable to Eclipse for the desktop. AIDE offers a free version (restricted) and a 10 US dollar premium key.

Features
--------

APDE strives to be a fully-featured Processing editor, using the PDE as a model. It currently includes many of the features present in the PDE, including:

 - "Run" button compiles and launches the sketch (you must enable "Install from Unknown Sources", see below)
 - Multiple files (tabs)
 - Nested file manager, support for organizing sketches into folders
 - Import contributed libraries, which are dexed upon installation to speed up build times
 - Export sketch as a signed APK file or as an Eclipse-compatible Android project
 - Internal Android Manifest file configuration (sketch permissions, orientation lock, etc.)
 - Sketch output and exceptions in console by injecting a log broadcaster (may be disabled)
 - Undo/Redo
 - Add files to sketch's "data" folder
 - A set of examples (more to come soon)
 - Color selector
 - Change sketch icon wizard
 - Auto format, comment/uncomment, increase/decrease indent
 - Syntax highlighting
 - Automatic saving

These are a few of the key features, but you will find that there are more in the app. I plan to add the following features at some point in the future (some are more distant than others!):

 - Contributed tools
 - Internal documentation
 - Git integration, possibly even for synchronization across the PDE and APDE if a Git client for the PDE is created
 - Support for JavaScript mode (maybe others... but "standard" mode doesn't make any sense)

Key Changes from the PDE
------------------------

Before you begin to use APDE, it is important to understand some differences between the desktop PDE and APDE.

Firstly, the sketch's name is determined by the name of the sketch folder, but the main sketch file/tab does not need to have this name. Presently, there is no concept of a "main" tab; I think that this is a beneficial re-thinking of the sketch's structure. It makes more sense because all of the tabs are combined anyway, without regard for any "main" tab, except that the "main" tab is added first. Consequently, the default name of the initial tab is just "sketch", and it will likely stay that way the majority of simple applications. I may end up changing this functionality to mimic the PDE, though, if it is necessary purely for compatibility if I implement Git integration, for example.

The default sketch name is "sketch", unlike the PDE, which creates a new sketch name based on the date/time for every new sketch. As such, the name "sketch" is also invalid, and this sketch cannot be saved. It must be renamed first. I may change this, as well, to make it easier to use...

APDE doesn't use ANT to build sketches - instead, it uses a custom build chain. The main difference between ANT and APDE's build sequence is that APDE uses the Eclipse Java Compiler (ECJ) instead of the JDK Java compiler (JAVAC). The build process is described in more detail below.

APDE libraries are dexed when they are installed. This means that you have to use the built-in installer ("Install Compressed Library" from the Library Manager), otherwise the build won't work properly (unless you want to dex the libraries yourself, of course). This decision was made to significantly improve build times (dexing the libraries can take several minutes, depending on the library and the device).

There is currently no library downloader. Libraries must be downloaded manually (there is a link, "Get Libraries" in the Library Manager) and then installed with the installer described above. I am staying away from adding an installer right now for fear of Google Play policy (see [ArduinoDroid](http://arduinodroid.blogspot.com/2014/03/arduinodroid-is-temporarily-removed.html) as an example). I consider the Library Installer (well, extractor and dexifier) dangerous enough, so I don't want to make things any worse. At some point in time, I may release a separate application that serves as a download manager (modularization), but that is a challenge for later.

The code folder is supported, but like libraries, the JARs must be dexed and placed in a "code-dex" folder in the sketch folder (beside the "code" folder). Once dexed, the JAR's name must be exactly the same, but have "-dex" at the end, before the ".jar". For example: "MyJavaLibrary.jar", when dexed, must be named "MyJavaLibrary-dex.jar". There is a DX Dexer tool in the Library Manager to enable this process on a device. I should probably get around to making this user experience better at some point in time, but I don't see this feature being used much to begin with...

Basic Use
---------

When you first open APDE, it is possible to start coding right away. However, before you can run it, you must save the sketch (from the action overflow menu). You do not need to save the sketch again (it will save automatically), but you can always invoke the save command to manually save.

To access a list of all of sketches, either press the APDE icon in the top left corner, swipe in from the left side of the screen, or select "Load Sketch" from the menu. You will be presented with the folders "Sketches", "Examples", "Library Examples", and "Recent". These categories should be self-explanatory. After navigating into one of the folders, you can navigate back out by pressing the ".." button at the top of the list. You can select a sketch (or example) to open it. The previously open sketch will be automatically saved (unless it has not been saved yet, in which case you will be prompted with a dialog).

In the sketch list, you can long press on a sketch (or a folder) to move it around (unless you have 2.3.3, in which case... sorry. The drag and drop APIs weren't added until 3.0... I'll have to make a custom implementation eventually). Drop the sketch into a folder or the parent folder ("..") to move it there. You can also drop it onto one of the three buttons at the bottom. The plus button will move the sketch to a new folder. The pencil button will rename the sketch. The trash can button will delete the sketch. You can also manage sketches/folders from a file manager (even on 2.3.3), but these features are present to make things easier.

Many of the menu items are duplicated in the Sketch Properties view, although there are some differences ("Delete Sketch" is only accessible from Sketch Properties, for example).

Renaming the sketch (from Sketch Properties) will also rename the sketch as it is saved in the Sketchbook folder. This differs from the PDE's "Save As".

To increase the size of the console, you can long-press the message area. After the device-specified amount of time, the message area will appear selected (and there will be a vibration, if your device has a vibrator and vibrations are enabled). At this point, you can drag the message area, resizing the code area and the console accordingly.

To install a library from the editor menu, navigate to Tools > Import Library > Manage Libraries > Install Compressed Library (in the overflow menu). Select the downloaded library's ZIP file (if you don't have a file manager, the aFileChooser library should provide one). A dialog will appear displaying the progress of the installation. Dexing the library will take a while, so be patient. Every second that you spend waiting for the library to dex is one less second that you have to wait every time that you build a sketch. When the dialog closes, the library should appear in the list; it has been installed.

The Color Selector and Auto Format tools are available from the Tools menu (as well as Import Library). The text selection tools (Comment/Uncomment, Inrease Indent, and Decrease Indent) are available from the overflow menu after selecting text (but not in 2.3.3). However, it appears that an Android bug causes the menu to disappear immediately on some (most?) devices - of the devices tested, only the Samsung ones displayed the menu properly. So this might not be useful for all that many people.

Running the Sketch
------------------

To run the sketch, select the "Run" button (a symbol similar to that found in the PDE). The build process will occur. Lots of technical details will get spit out in the console, while general updates will appear in the message area.

If there is a basic sketch error, the message area will likely inform you about this, while the caret will jump to the offending line (in a similar fashion to the PDE).

If a more advanced error is detected by ECJ, then the the message area will say something like "Build failed, check the console". In this case, you must read through the console log. ECJ's output will tell you everything that is wrong all at once... it is a good idea to learn how to interpret it.

Once all of the errors have been ironed out, the sketch should run smoothly, resulting in a pop-up window detailing the sketch as an application to be installed.

You may need to enable "Installation from Unknown Sources" (location varies, typically something like Settings > Applications > Development). Once the sketch is installed, you can open it.

You need not build the sketch every time you wish to run it, unless you have made changes. The sketch is installed on the device like any other app.

Build times vary based on your device and the size of your sketch, and are typically around five to ten seconds for me. At any point in the build, you can press the "Stop" button (next to "Run") to halt the process.

Technical Information
---------------------

APDE uses a custom build sequence. These are the steps used to build sketches, as can be seen from the console output:
 - Processing Preprocessor (ANTLR), basically the same as the PDE
 - AAPT, Android SDK binary that creates R.java and bundles the resources
 - ECJ, Eclipse Java Compiler, compiles resulting source files, spits out errors
 - DX Dexer, Android SDK JAR, converts compiled .class files to Android's .dex (Dalvik EXecutable) files
 - DX Merger, Android SDK JAR, merges all of the .dex files into one bit .dex file
 - APKBuilder, creates an APK (Android Package) file from the resources and the DEX files
 - ZipSigner, Android library that zipaligns the APK and also signs it with a debug certificate

Upon completion of this build sequence, the sketch is launched. For those interested, the build process is located in the `build()` method of `com.calsignlabs.apde.build.Build.java`.

Libraries are dexed during the installation process to speed up build times.

How to Build
------------

I have been developing APDE, in my free time, for roughly the past year (at time of writing). Anyone that would like a new feature, or has a bug fix, is welcome to submit a pull request.

If you wish to build APDE yourself, then there are several steps you must take to set up your Eclipse environment.

I use Eclipse ADT v23. To download ADT, please visit the [Android Developers website](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html). However, if you have done Android development in Processing before, chances are that you already have this installed.

On top of Eclipse, I use the EGit plugin to push commits to GitHub. This isn't necessary, as you can use Git from the command line (as many hardcore Git users would probably prefer). To install EGit, please visit the [Eclipse website](http://www.eclipse.org/egit/download/). You may need to install Git as well.

APDE currently uses several libraries, but two must be added to your workspace as library projects because they require resources. They are Android-Support-V7-Appcomat (for the ActionBar on 2.3) and aFileChooser (as a file selector dialog on devices that don't have a file management app). You can view the instructions for how to install the support libraries on the [Android Developers Website](http://developer.android.com/tools/support-library/setup.html#add-library). You can download and set up aFileChooser from its [GitHub page](https://github.com/iPaulPro/aFileChooser). Of course, you must add these projects as library projects from APDE's Project Properties.

That should be all of the outstanding steps necessary for building APDE. If I have missed something, then I can update the instructions.
