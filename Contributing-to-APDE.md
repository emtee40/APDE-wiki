Anyone that would like to implement a feature or fix a bug is welcome to submit a pull request. I am also grateful for feature requests, bug reports, and any other feedback in general.

If you want to build APDE yourself, then you should set up [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html) and clone this repo. APDE requires Androidx (formerly known as the support library). All other required libraries are included in the repo.

Building APDE in Android Studio should work right out of the box given that everything is up-to-date. If you encounter issues while trying to build then please send me an email or create an issue.
