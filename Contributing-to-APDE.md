Anyone that would like to implement a feature or fix a bug is welcome to submit a pull request. I am also grateful for feature requests, bug reports, and any other feedback in general.

If you want to build APDE yourself, then you should set up [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html) and clone the repository. APDE requires the v7 support library. I try to keep APDE up-to-date with the latest versions of the SDK and all of the libraries, but it may be lagging behind a little bit.

As far as I know, building APDE in Android Studio should work right out of the box given that everything is up-to-date. If you encounter issues while trying to build then please send me an email.
