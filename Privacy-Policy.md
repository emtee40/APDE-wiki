APDE is developed by CalsignLabs (William Smith). I provide this open source service at no cost and it is intended for use as is. If you use APDE, then you agree to the privacy policy set forth below.

***

APDE and CalsignLabs collect no personal information. In fact, APDE does not collect any information at all beyond the data that is stored directly on your device (sketches, settings, etc.).

APDE does not use tracking services or send information to other devices or servers beyond what is required to (1) download examples, (2) interact with remote git repositories, and (3) display the reference pages.

1. Downloading the examples repository connects to GitHub servers. GitHub can track your information as per GitHub's privacy policy. APDE does not handle any of this information itself.
2. APDE contains a git client that allows you to interact with remote git servers. Those servers may handle your information with their own privacy policies.
3. APDE connects to the Processing website to display reference pages. Any websites that you visit through APDE's reference feature handle your information according to their own privacy policies.

APDE also uses Google Play Services in a limited capacity (for running sketches on Wear OS devices), although it does not use these services for any tracking features. Google Play Services handles information according to its own privacy policy.

CalsignLabs reserves the right to modify this privacy policy at any time. I do not expect to make any major changes with the exception of potential feature additions, which will be explained in the release notes, but it is your responsibility to check this page for updates to this privacy policy.
